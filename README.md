## Rails Boilerplate

This is a template repo for setting up a basic Rails app.

In addition to the basics generated by `rails new`:

- Has one controller and action `home#index`
- Uses TailwindCSS and esbuild for assets
- `rspec-rails`
- Rubocop configuration
- GitHub actions for building and linting
- Makefile
